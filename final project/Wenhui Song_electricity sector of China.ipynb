    "This year, China faced its worst power shortage in a decade, which rippled across factories and households recently. Power rationing for factories and businesses became in effect, with some provinces ordering factories to halt production for a few days each week. Reactions from citizens are a mix of fear and frustration, as power cuts are often made with no warning. It not only affected China’s domestic social order but also raised international concerns.\n",
    "\n",
    "Why has China been hit by power shortages? There are two major interconnected explanations. For one thing, the country struggled to balance electricity supplies with demand, which was boosted during the pandemic. For another, with Beijing attempting to make the country carbon neutral by 2060, China is trying to slow coal production, which accounts for the majority of China’s electricity resources. However, despite many discussions surrounding these two arguments, little data has been cited as evidence. So I want to make some efforts to fill the gap and do some experimental exploration.\n",
    "\n",
    "In my notebook, I drew data from China’s official websites and Wikipedia, looking at these two explanations by 4 visualized pictures. I divided my notebook into three parts. \n",
    "\n",
    "I offered an overview of China’s electricity generation & consumption situation and power resources in 2021 by utilizing the recent 9 reports released by China Electricity Council (CEC)（Since the reports were in PDF formats, I had to manually adjust them). From the “Chart: Electricity Deficit in China (2021))” [line 11], we can see a status of electricity deficit in China in the past 9 months, which is especially severe in May and August. If we compare this chart to the “Chart: Electricity Generation by Source (2021)”[line 12], we would find that during August, the electricity generation is relatively high (except for Lunar New Year). However, even with more generation volume, the deficit is still high. It seems to foresee the electricity shortage in September this year.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the second and third parts, I analyzed how the supply-demand relationship and generation resources changed over time. From “Electricity Surplus in China (generation-consumption) (2001-2019)”[line 24], we can see that the annual statistic shows the opposite result from the previous monthly statistics, displaying an increasing electricity surplus status. Why is that? I think it’s necessary to look at the calculating criteria and ask for some expert insights.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, I drew a picture “Chart: Electricity Production By Source (2008-2019)”[line 36]. From this, we can see that fossil fuel, of which coal is a major part, keeps increasing. While at the same time, the amount of electricity generation generated by hydro is also rising. We could see the effort of Beijing developing renewable resources but more comparison analysis is needed if we need to evaluate to what extent such effort works.\n",
